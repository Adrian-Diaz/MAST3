# MAST3: Exploring a new architecture for MAST

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/MASTmultiphysics/MAST3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/MASTmultiphysics/MAST3)

## Important Note
This repository is for MAST3, which is a refactoring to explore a more maintainable, extendable, and efficient architecture for MAST. It is currently a work in progress and not all of the physics/capabilities of the previous MAST code are available. The previous MAST code is available [here](https://github.com/MASTmultiphysics/mast-multiphysics).

## Documentation Sites:
- [https://mast3.mast-multiphysics.com](https://mast3.mast-multiphysics.com) - documentation website generated for the last commit on the `master` branch.
- [https://mast3-temp-docs.mast-multiphysics.com](https://mast3-temp-docs.mast-multiphysics.com) - contains archives of the documentation website produced by Doxygen for **ALL** jobs run by Travis CI. If you make documentation updates in a non-master branch or in a Pull Request, check here to make sure the website isn't broken before merging to `master`. Old archives will be deleted after 24-48 hours.

The documentation website for the end of the master branch of MAST3 is

# MAST: Multidisciplinary-design Adaptation and Sensitivity Toolkit
The Multidisciplinary-design Adaptation and Sensitivity Toolkit (MAST) is a sensitivity-enabled, multiphysics FEA tool developed to support computational design and engineering analysis.

In addition to analysis of complex, nonlinear physics on large built-up models, MAST supports efficient analytical gradient/sensitivity calculation using direct and adjoint methods. As a result, it is well suited for gradient-based multidisciplinary design optimization processes.

MAST is developed at the [Computational Dynamics and Design Laboratory](http://bhatia.ae.msstate.edu) at Mississippi State University in collaboration with the [Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)](https://www.afresearchlab.com) Multidisciplinary Science and Technology Center (MSTC).
